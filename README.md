## What is Tampermonkey?

Tampermonkey is a free browser extension that allows users to install and run user scripts that modify the behavior of web pages. Tampermonkey scripts can be used to add new functionality, change the appearance of web pages, or automate repetitive tasks.

## How to Install Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Google Chrome or from the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) website for Firefox. After installing the extension, you should see a Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar.
